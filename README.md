## Extension Changer: 
I'm used to downloading a lot of youtube videos. And sometimes if they are in other languages I have to download the subtitles along with it. The subtitles file that gets downloaded from youtube tends to be in "vtt" format. But to run the subtitles, I need the files to be in "srt" format. Hence this is where I came up with the extension changer. On one single click, I'm able to convert multiple "vtt" format files to "srt" format.
